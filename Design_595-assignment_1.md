# Assignment 1 - Site Assessment
For the website assigned below, perform a short assessment on the interface of the website. Pay attention to the following:

- Content (what it actually says, how it is divided into sections)
- General design
- Photography/Illustration
- Hero
- Navigation
- Footer
- Interactivity (animations, transitions, etc)

## Tasks
1. Draft a simple user persona for the audience you believe the website is primarily be targeting (a photo, a name, a paragraph that describes that user). 
2. Discuss a few of the elements above that you feel are well done, and how they've considered the audience. If applicable, what elements could have been done better.
3. Finally, answer the question: *Is this a well-designed website?* and discuss why or why not.
