## Projects

### Conference speakers
Client: Code Canada (Ladies Learning Code)  
[website](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/chapters/edmonton/)  
The Edmonton Chapter of Code Canada is doing a Ladies Learning Code one-day conference in May. They are looking for speakers for the conference and need a landing page for applications. They are hoping to target people who might not have a lot of experience speaking but are willing to offer some coaching/mentoring to anyone interested in speaking. They are also hoping to encourage women to sign up to speak so the site should reflect this. Users should be able to apply to speak, provide a bit about them, a synopsis of their talk and some discussion about how experienced they are and if they would like some coaching to put the talk together.

### Mental health cookie day
Client: Bloom Cookie Co.  
[website](https://www.bloomcookieco.ca/)  
On World Mental Health Day, Bloom Cookie Co. wants to raise money for the Mental Health Foundation by selling and delivering dozen boxes of cookies via a website. Users should be able to order a box of cookies, specify where to deliver and pay for the cookies. 

### Barista training night
Client: The Grizzlar  
[website](https://www.thegrizzlar.com/)  
The Grizzlar is doing a series of one-night classes (every Wednesday over July/August) to teach people how to create espresso-based drinks. Users can choose the amount they pay for the evening which is a charitable donation to the Bissell Centre. The site should allow users to sign up, pick a night and choose how much they will donate. They must also be able to get a charitable tax-receipt.

### Illustration conference volunteers
Client: Adobe  
[website](https://www.adobe.com/)  
Adobe is putting on a three-day conference in Edmonton with speakers, workshops and events. They are looking for local volunteers for various duties (registration, greeting, ticket-checking, speaker-wrangling etc). The site should allow interested users to register to volunteer, choose the duties they would prefer to do and the shifts they will take. They must also be able to choose a shirt size (for their volunteer shirt).

### Call for artists for residency
Client: SNAP Gallery   
[website](https://snapartists.com/printshop/artists-in-residence/)   
The Society of Northern Alberta Print-artists is starting a new initiative to promote their artists in residency program. The volunteer position would be a weekly commitment for twelve weeks. The landing page should inform the potential artists of the benefits of volunteering but also of the obligation (because they want to screen out people who can't commit). SNAP is also looking for artists who might be more on the fringes of mainstream art (eg: from marginalized communities, differing perspectives) so the website's design and communication should reflect that. Users should be able to apply for the role by providing their contact information, a short biography and background of their artistic experience. They should also be able to add any social media or website links they have.

### Blood drive
Client: Canadian Blood Services  
[website](https://blood.ca/en)  
Canadian Blood Services wants to create a campaign that targets athletes to give blood. Create a signup form which allows the user to pick a time and location to give blood. The user should also be able to share their involvement on social media to inspire more people to give blood.

### Film festival submission
Client: EIFF Festival   
[website](http://www.edmontonfilmfest.com/)  
The EIFF is looking for entries for their independent short film competition. The competition entries must be films under 40min and produced with a budget less than $5000 and no grant or outside funding. EIFF wants to target Edmonton and area filmmakers but the competition is open to anyone in the province. Users must be able to enter the competition with their contact details, biography, film credits and upload their film and a cover image (with specific parameters for file format and size).
