## Projects

### Conference speakers
Client: Code Canada (Ladies Learning Code)  
[website](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/chapters/edmonton/)  
The Edmonton Chapter of Code Canada is doing a Ladies Learning Code one-day conference in May. They are looking for speakers for the conference and need a landing page for applications. They are hoping to target people who might not have a lot of experience speaking but are willing to offer some coaching/mentoring to anyone interested in speaking. They are also hoping to encourage women to sign up to speak so the site should reflect this. Users should be able to apply to speak, provide a bit about them, a synopsis of their talk and some discussion about how experienced they are and if they would like some coaching to put the talk together.

### Mental health cookie day
Client: Bloom Cookie Co.  
[website](https://www.bloomcookieco.ca/)  
On World Mental Health Day, Bloom Cookie Co. wants to raise money for the Mental Health Foundation by selling and delivering dozen boxes of cookies via a website. Users should be able to order a box of cookies, specify where to deliver and pay for the cookies. 

### Barista training night
Client: The Grizzlar  
[website](https://www.thegrizzlar.com/)  
The Grizzlar is doing a series of one-night classes (every Wednesday over July/August) to teach people how to create espresso-based drinks. Users can choose the amount they pay for the evening which is a charitable donation to the Bissell Centre. The site should allow users to sign up, pick a night and choose how much they will donate. They must also be able to get a charitable tax-receipt.

### Skateboard facilitator training
Client: Tigers Skate Club  
[website](https://www.instagram.com/tigersskateclub/)  
Tigers Skate Club is hosting a course for people interested in learning how to teach skateboarding. The signup should include gathering some information on the user's experience as a skateboarder or working with people. It should also gather some information to determine if the user is a good fit with the club's objectives.

### Call for artists for residency
Client: SNAP Gallery   
[website](https://snapartists.com/printshop/artists-in-residence/)   
The Society of Northern Alberta Print-artists is starting a new initiative to promote their artists in residency program. The volunteer position would be a weekly commitment for twelve weeks. The landing page should inform the potential artists of the benefits of volunteering but also of the obligation (because they want to screen out people who can't commit). SNAP is also looking for artists who might be more on the fringes of mainstream art (eg: from marginalized communities, differing perspectives) so the website's design and communication should reflect that. Users should be able to apply for the role by providing their contact information, a short biography and background of their artistic experience. They should also be able to add any social media or website links they have.
